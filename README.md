# KDT
KDT is a command line client for [Kondukto](https://kondukto.io) written in [Go](https://golang.org). It interacts with Kondukto engine through public API. 

With KDT, you can list projects and their scans in **Kondukto**, and restart a scan with a specific application security tool. KDT is also easy to use in CI/CD pipelines to trigger scans and break releases if a scan fails or scan results don't met specified release criteria. 

### What is Kondukto?
[Kondukto](https://kondukto.io) is an Application Security Testing Orchestration platform that helps you centralize and automate your entire AppSec related vulnerability management process. Providing an interface where security health of applications can be continuously monitored, and a command line interface where your AppSec operations can be integrated into DevOps pipelines, Kondukto lets you manage your AppSec processes automatically with ease.

## Installation
You can install the CLI with a `curl` utility script or by downloading the pre-compiled binary from the Github release page.
Once installed youl'll get the `kdt-cli` command and `kdt` alias.

Utility script with `curl`:
```
$ curl -sSL https://cli.kondukto.io | sudo sh
```

Non-root with curl:
```
$ curl -sSL https://cli.kondukto.io | sh
```

### Windows 
To install the kdt-cli on Windows go to [Releases](https://github.com/kondukto-io/kdt/releases) and download the latest kdt-cli.exe.


Or you can also simply run the following if you have an existing [Go](https://golang.org) environment:
```
go get github.com/kondukto-io/kdt
```

If you want to build it yourself, clone the source files using Github, change into the `kdt` directory and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/kondukto-io/kdt.git
cd kdt
go install
```

## Configuration
KDT needs Kondukto host and an API token for authentication. API tokens can be created under Integrations/API Tokens menu.

You can provide configuration by:

##### 1) Setting environment variables: 

*(example is for BASH shell)*
```
$ export KONDUKTO_HOST=http://localhost:8080
$ export KONDUKTO_TOKEN=WmQ2eHFDRzE3elplN0ZRbUVsRDd3VnpUSHk0TmF6Uko5OGlyQ1JvR2JOOXhoWEFtY2ZrcDJZUGtrb2tV
```
It is always better to set environment variables in shell profile files(`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile` etc.)
##### 2) Providing a configuration file.

Default path for config file is `$HOME/.kdt.yaml`. Another file can be provided with `--config` command line flag.
```
// $HOME/.kdt.yaml 
host: http://localhost:8088
token: WmQ2eHFDRzE3elplN0ZRbUVsRDd3VnpUSHk0TmF6Uko5OGlyQ1JvR2JOOXhoWEFtY2ZrcDJZUGtrb2tV
```

##### 3) Using command line flags
```
kdt list projects --host http://localhost:8088 --token WmQ2eHFDRzE3elplN0ZRbUVsRDd3VnpUSHk0TmF6Uko5OGlyQ1JvR2JOOXhoWEFtY2ZrcDJZUGtrb2tV
```

## Running
Most KDT commands are straightforward.

To list projects: `kdt list projects`

To list scans of a project: `kdt list scans -p ExampleProject`

To restart a scan, you can use one of the following:

- id of the scan: `kdt scan -s 5da6cafa5ab6e436faf643dc`

- project and tool names: `kdt scan -p ExampleProject -t ExampleTool`

## Command Line Flags
KDT has several helpful flags to manage scans.

#### Global flags

Following flags are valid for all commands of KDT.

`--host`: HTTP address of Kondukto server with port

`--token`: API token generated by Kondukto

`--config`: Configuration file to use instead of default one(`$HOME/.kdt.yaml`)

`--async`: Starts an asynchronous scan that won't block process to wait for scan to finish. KDT will exit gracefully when scan gets started successfully.

`--insecure`: If provided, client skips verification of server's certificates and host name. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Not recommended unless you really know what you are doing!

`-v` or `--verbose`: Prints more and detailed logs. Useful for debugging.

#### Scan Commands Flags
Following flags are only valid for scan commands.

`-p` or `--project` for providing project name or id

`-t` or `--tool` for providing tool name

`-s` or `--scan-id` for providing scan id

##### Threshold flags

These flags represent maximum number of vulnerabilities with specified severity to ignore. If these threshold are crossed, KDT will exit with non-zero status code.


`--threshold-crit` 

`--threshold-high` 

`--threshold-med` 

`--threshold-low` 

`--threshold-risk` for failing tests if the scan causes a higher risk score than the last scan's risk score. Useful for keeping a project's security level under control. If used with every scan in DevOps pipelines, you will make sure that the project will never get more vulnerable.

*Risk threshold considers only the last two scans with the same tool. If the project does not have a scan with the tool, KDT will fail since it will not be able to compare risk scores.*

*Threshold flags don't work with `--async` flag since KDT will exit when scan gets started, and won't be able to check scan results*

Example Usage:

`kdt scan -p SampleProject -t SampleTool --threshold-crit 3 --threshold-high 10 --threshold-risk`
